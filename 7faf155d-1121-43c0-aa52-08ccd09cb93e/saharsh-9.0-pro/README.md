## How to Play
1. **Select a Map**: Use the Up/Down arrow keys or mouse to select a difficulty from the list.
2. **Toggle Mods**: Click the mod icons or press `F1` (not implemented yet, just click) to enable modifiers.
3. **Start**: Press `Enter` or click the map card to begin.
4. **Controls**:
   - **Aim**: Follow the objects with your mouse cursor.
   - **Tap**: Press `Z` or `X` to hit objects in time with the music.

## Technical Notes
- **Audio Sync**: The game uses a custom synchronization timer tied to the Web Audio hardware clock to ensure perfect sync even if the frame rate drops.
- **Parsing**: A custom `.osu` parser handles v14 beatmap files directly in the browser.
- **Storage**: High scores are saved locally using `localStorage`.
