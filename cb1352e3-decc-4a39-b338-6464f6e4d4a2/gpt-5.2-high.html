When an encounter triggers, the game enters a turn-based battle overlay.

### Player Stats

### Skills
- **1 — Homework Strike:** solid damage; scales with combo
- **2 — Study Shield:** blocks the next hits
- **3 — Speed Dash:** adds dodge/initiative style buffs
- **4 — Excuse Escape:** attempt to flee (chance depends on SPD + zone)

## Outsmart Mini-Games

Some rivals/bosses can be approached via mini-games instead of direct fighting.

- **Reaction timing:** hit Space when the marker is in the success zone.
- **Focus memory:** memorize and click the flashing sequence in order.

Failing can still lead to battle or consequences, keeping the pace high.

---

- Earning **3 credits**
- Clearing the **Gym boss**
- Reaching the **Exam Wing** and defeating **The Teacher** before time runs out

## Tech Notes

- **Rendering:** Three.js (WebGL)
- **UI:** Tailwind via CDN
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` with namespaced keys using `location.pathname` to avoid conflicts

---

## Tips

- The **Library is your reset button**: recover, shop, breathe.

- Use **Skip Turn / stamina recovery** in battle when low.
- Stack Knowledge early if you want the best ending.
