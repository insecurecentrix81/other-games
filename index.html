   <pre>Game Created Successfully! 🤠<br>I've created Red Dead Redemption 2: Wild West Showdown - a simplified 2D top-down shooter adaptation of the classic Wild West game.<br><br>🎮 HOW TO PLAY:<br>WASD - Move your gunslinger around<br>Mouse - Aim your weapon<br>Left Click - Shoot<br>R - Reload your revolver<br>🎯 GAME FEATURES:<br>Wild West Setting (1899) - Authentic cowboy theme with desert landscapes<br>Wave-Based Combat - Fight off increasingly difficult waves of outlaws<br>Shooting Mechanics - Aim, shoot, and reload your weapon<br>Health System - Take damage from enemy outlaws and try to survive<br>Score & Progression - Earn points and advance through 10 challenging waves<br>Particle Effects - Gunshot effects, blood splatter, and dynamic visuals<br>Mission Objectives - Complete waves to progress and become a legend<br>📝 GAME EXPLANATION:<br>The requested game (Red Dead Redemption 2) is an extremely complex AAA open-world game that's impossible to recreate in a single HTML file. Instead, I've created a functional 2D action shooter prototype that captures the spirit of the Wild West, featuring:<br><br>✅ 1899 time period setting with desert/western aesthetic<br>✅ Cowboy protagonist (you play as a lone gunslinger)<br>✅ Action-packed combat against outlaw enemies<br>✅ Shooting mechanics with reload system<br>✅ Mission-based gameplay (survive 10 waves)<br>✅ Wild West theme with appropriate colors and styling<br><br>The game is fully playable and increases in difficulty as you progress through the waves. Good luck, partner! 🌵🔫</pre>

   <pre>### Game explanation and how to play<br><br>Controls<br>- Click the 3D view to lock the pointer (Pointer Lock).  <br>- WASD — move around.  <br>- Mouse — look around.  <br>- Space — jump.  <br>- E — interact with nearby switches.  <br>- Click the "Restart" button or "Play Again" to reset the prototype.<br><br>Objective<br>- You play as a prototype avatar of "Saharash" (portrait used as a sprite). Collect 5 assignment cubes (blue) to improve your grade and win. Avoid red spinners (distractions) that reduce HP and lower grades. Flip yellow switches (press E near them) to open doors or change the environment.<br><br>HUD<br>- Top-left shows current Grade, HP, and progress bar.  <br>- Bottom center shows how many assignments you've collected out of 5.<br><br>Win / Lose<br>- Collect all 5 assignments to win (Semester Passed).  <br>- If HP drops to 0, you fail (Semester Failed).<br><br>Prototype notes (what was simplified)<br>- The user requested a 3D action-puzzle-adventure about playing as Saharash failing classes and using SecureCentrix. That concept is large for a single-file deliverable, so this is a functional prototype capturing the spirit:<br>  - 3D world built with three.js in a single HTML file.<br>  - Avatar uses the provided portrait as a billboard sprite to represent Saharash.<br>  - Core mechanics included: movement, jumping, collectibles (assignments), hazards (distractions), switches that open a door, simple grade and HP system.<br>  - No network, accounts, or real secure platform integration (only a themed scene named Secure Centrix81). No persistent saving, advanced AI enemies, or large open-world features due to single-file constraints.<br><br>If you want<br>- More levels, animated 3D character model, physics-based puzzles (matter.js), or more sophisticated enemies, tell me which feature to expand and I will produce an updated single-file prototype focused on that area.<br></pre>
